# Project Objectives
The primary goal of this two-month project is to generate basic walking patterns of the humanoid robot RH5 using three open-source optimal control frameworks.

In particular, this involves understanding and getting to work the examples of bipedal walking that come along with the frameworks, integrating a universal description of RH5, and comparing the frameworks in terms of performance for bipedal walking.
