\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\textbf{Project Objectives}

The primary goal of this two-month project is to gain insights about the bipedal walking capabilities of two open-source frameworks for optimal control of robots (Crocoddyl, Drake).

\textbf{In particular, this involves}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Installing and familiarizing with the libraries description of dynamical systems and optimization problems,
\item Working with the provided examples, especially those related to legged-locomotion,
\item Integrating a universal description of the RH5 robot and test the solvers 
\item Comparing the frameworks in terms of suitability for performing bipedal walking tasks.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Organisation}

All tasks related to this project are handled as issues and managed centrally from the \textbf{related repository} \cite{julesserOCFrameworks}.
Even though most of the implementation  is done in the forked repositories of the according frameworks, this seems to be a clear way of organizing.
