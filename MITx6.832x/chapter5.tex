\section{Lyapunov Functions}
\subsection{Optimization Crash Course}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: Find $x_{min}$ for an objective (cost) function considering a set of (in/equality-) constraints
\item Popular objective functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Convex quadratic cost (least squares)
\item Linear cost
\end{itemize}
\item Convex optimization builds on convex cost functions or a convex set
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Introduction}
Lyapunov functions generalize this notion of an energy function to more general systems, which might not be stable in the sense of some mechanical energy. If I can find any positive function, call it$V(\myM{x})$, that gets smaller over time as the system evolves, then I can potentially use $V$ to make a statement about the long-term behavior of the system. $V$is called a Lyapunov function. 

\subsection{Computing Lyapunow Functions}
Idea: Parameterize lyapunov candidate.
