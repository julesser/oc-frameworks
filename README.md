# Optimal Control Frameworks for Bipedal Walking
This repository contains information about the project progress and the LaTeX documentation.

### Project Objectives
The primary goal of this two-month project is to gain insights about the bipedal walking capabilities of two open-source frameworks for optimal control of robots (Crocoddyl, Drake).

In particular, this involves 
1. Installing and familiarizing with the libraries description of dynamical systems and optimization problems,
2. Working with the provided examples, especially those related to legged-locomotion,
3. Integrating a universal description of RH5 and test the solvers 
4. Comparing the frameworks in terms of suitability for performing bipedal walking tasks.

### Organisation
All task related to this project are handled as **issues** and managed centrally from this repository. 
Even though most of the implementation  is done in the forked repositories of the according frameworks, this seems to be a clear way of organizing.
