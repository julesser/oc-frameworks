# Optimal Control Frameworks
This repository contains information about the project progress and the LaTeX documentation.

### Project Objectives
The primary goal of this two-month project is to generate basic walking trajectories of the humanoid robot RH5 using three open-source optimal control frameworks.

In particular, this involves 
1. Understanding and getting to work the examples of bipedal walking that come along with the frameworks,
2. Integrating a universal description of RH5 and 
3. Comparing the frameworks in terms of performance for bipedal walking.

### Organisation
All task related to this project are handled as **issues** and managed centrally from this repository. 
Even though most of the implementation  is done in the forked repositories of the according frameworks, this seems to be a clear way of organizing.
